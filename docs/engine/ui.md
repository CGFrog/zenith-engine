# Runtime game UI

Part of the [repository guide](../REPOSITORY_GUIDE.md).

## `src/engine/ui/GameUi.*`

Provides a resolution-independent command API for runtime menus and HUDs.
Applications receive a `GameUiContext` through `ApplicationContext` and emit
panels, text, images, and buttons using a 1920x1080 design canvas. The context
owns anchor resolution, uniform scaling, clipping, pointer hit testing, focus,
and action-driven navigation. Game code exchanges only engine handles and
domain types; the renderer privately translates commands to its ImGui Vulkan
backend after tone mapping.

Font files are cached as CPU assets through `AssetManager::loadFont`, while UI
images reuse normal `TextureHandle` values and the renderer's texture cache.

`Localization.*` owns stable message IDs, locale/plural selection, and UTF-8
fallback shaping. `Accessibility.*` owns timed caption tracks and
color-independent indicator semantics. `InputProfiles.*` stores named,
remappable keyboard, mouse, and gamepad profiles with explicit conflict and
hold/toggle policies.
